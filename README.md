Happy Dogs is a website for a fictional dog grooming business that offers various salon services for dogs. Inspiration for the idea came from a family member who is working on creating such a business for themselves. 
The brief for this first Milestone project was to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using HTML5 and CSS3. It is the first of four projects as part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

#UX (User Experience)

### Goals

In terms of my fictional business, the goal was to.
 - Make a user-friendly website to attract new customers.
 - Inform potential customers of the range of services provided while guideing them to book an appointment.
 - Facilitate the booking process.
 - Allow the business to be located via *Google maps*.
 - Enure the website is able to be viewed on divices and screens of all sizes.


### User Stories

1. I Googled dog grooming services in my area and
  As a potential customer, I want to see services on offer and get a feel for the company.
2. As a potential customer who has had a bad experience at a competitor, I want to know who the groomers are and if they are reliable.
3. As a potential user, I would like some visual information to determine the reliablity of this business.
4. As a potential user, I browse websites on my mobile phone and want to have a good experience and be able to find and view the information I want.
5. As a potential user I want to know if this place is easy to get to.
6. As a potential customer I want to know what other people say about this business.
7. As a returning customer I want to be reminded of the services available and be able to make a booking easily.

### Design

I wanted the style of the website to feel professional without being too fancy... approachable without being too cutesey. I believe 'modern' would describe the style. I used this to inform my choices on colours, images and fonts. 

Colour Pallete

I used the coolers.co site to choose a complementary colour mix for my website. Innitially I had imagined a light turquiose in my mock ups but this looked too medical and I did not want the site to be mistaken for a vet instead of a grooming salon.

- ![#F7FFF7](https://placehold.it/15/F7FFF7/000000?text=+) #F7FFF7 'Mint Cream
- ![#FF6B6B](https://placehold.it/15/FF6B6B/000000?text=+) #FF6B6B 'Bittersweet' 
- ![#FFE66D](https://placehold.it/15/FFE66D/000000?text=+) #FFE66D 'Naples Yellow'

Typography

I did not want to make any bold statements with the typography. The main aim was to make the website readable and attractive. I chose the Montserrat font throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Monsterrat does not load correctly.

Imagery

?????????????????????????????

Wireframes

I did not create the website fully in a design tool only to then create it again in html/css. Instead I used design tools to mock up rough versions of my site design and colour combinations. Since this was a solo project, I was happy keeping some information (such as how the features would respond on mobile) in my head rather than drawing out the exact version of the final website. On collabarative projects, I would have a more finalised version of the website in a design tool, however.

### Features

#### Existing Features

#### Features To Be Implemented

- Pressing the 'Book Now' button under a particular service on the Services page should pre-select that service from the drop-down menu.
- A Gallery page with before and after images of styled dogs.
- A log in section for customers to make booking even easier. This would store their personal information so they wouldn't have to fill in the booking form. Additional features such as customer loyalty points could be implemented etc.

1. [Bootstrap 4.4.1:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)
    - Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.
1. [Hover.css:](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - Hover.css was used on the Social Media icons in the footer to add the float transition while being hovered over.
1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google fonts were used to import the 'Titillium Web' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
1. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
1. [jQuery:](https://jquery.com/)
    - jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
1. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

- [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
    * I decided to use Bootstrap's grid container system as I wanted to design my project with a 'mobile first' approach.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) 
    * Figma helped me crystalise my design ideas, including colour scheme, font style, image placement and overall page layout.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) 
    * I relied on five free FontAwesome icons for my design project.
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) 
    * This was the source of all of the images in my project.
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) 
    * I used TinyPNG to compress my image files to try to reduce the loading time for each page. 
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * I used one Google Font to create my logo and two more to style the content of the website.
- [Gauger Fonticon Generator](https://gauger.io/fonticon/) 
    * This free interactive Fonticon Generator allowed me to create a fonticon with a Font Awesome icon and style it with the colours from my colour scheme.
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
    * This was a great tool throughout the project to test my HTML and CSS code.
- [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    * I've refered to WSC Schools several times whilst building my project, especially when designing the modal for my contact form, as described [here.](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    * Although it isn't a technology, I found a lot of guidance on Stack Overflow and used [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/609273/convert-an-image-to-grayscale-in-html-css*/) to help me make images interactive on hover.

## Testing
    The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)

5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
