# Happy Dogs

## Code Institute Milestone Project 1

This website for a fictional company is created for educational purposes only.

![Happy Dogs Responsive](/assets/images/responsivedog.png)    
    
Happy Dogs is a website for a fictional dog grooming business that offers various salon services for dogs. Inspiration for the idea came from a family member who is working on creating such a business for themselves. 
The brief for this first Milestone project was to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using HTML5 and CSS3. It is the first of four projects as part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

#UX (User Experience)

### Goals

In terms of my fictional business, the goal was to.
 - Make a user-friendly website to attract new customers.
 - Inform potential customers of the range of services provided while guideing them to book an appointment.
 - Facilitate the booking process.
 - Allow the business to be located via *Google maps*.
 - Enure the website is able to be viewed on divices and screens of all sizes.


### User Stories

1. I Googled dog grooming services in my area and
  As a potential customer, I want to see services on offer and get a feel for the company.
2. As a potential customer who has had a bad experience at a competitor, I want to know who the groomers are and if they are reliable.
3. As a potential user, I browse websites on my mobile phone and want to have a good experience and be able to find and view the information I want.
4. As a potential user I want to know if this place is easy to get to.
5. As a potential customer I want to know what other people say about this business.
6. As a returning customer I want to be reminded of the services available and be able to make a booking easily.

### Design

I wanted the style of the website to feel professional without being too fancy... approachable without being too cutesey. I believe 'modern' would describe the style. I used this to inform my choices on colours, images and fonts. 

Colour Pallete

I used the coolers.co site to choose a complementary colour mix for my website. Innitially I had imagined a light turquiose in my mock ups but this looked too medical and I did not want the site to be mistaken for a vet instead of a grooming salon.

- ![#FFE66D](https://placehold.it/15/FFE66D/000000?text=+) #FFE66D 'Naples Yellow'

Typography

I did not want to make any bold statements with the typography. The main aim was to make the website readable and attractive. I chose the Montserrat font throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Monsterrat does not load correctly.

Imagery

?????????????????????????????

Wireframes

I did not create the website fully in a design tool only to then create it again in html/css. Instead I used design tools to mock up rough versions of my site design and colour combinations. Since this was a solo project, I was happy keeping some information (such as how the features would respond on mobile) in my head rather than drawing out the exact version of the final website. On collabarative projects, I would have a more finalised version of the website in a design tool, however.

#### Features To Be Implemented

- Pressing the 'Book Now' button under a particular service on the Services page should pre-select that service from the drop-down menu.
- A Gallery page with before and after images of styled dogs.
- A log in section for customers to make booking even easier. This would store their personal information so they wouldn't have to fill in the booking form. Additional features such as customer loyalty points could be implemented etc.

    - Hover.css was used on the Social Media icons in the footer to add the float transition while being hovered over.
1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google fonts were used to import the 'Titillium Web' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
1. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
1. [jQuery:](https://jquery.com/)
    - jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
1. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

- [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
    * I decided to use Bootstrap's grid container system as I wanted to design my project with a 'mobile first' approach.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) 
    * Figma helped me crystalise my design ideas, including colour scheme, font style, image placement and overall page layout.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) 
    * I relied on five free FontAwesome icons for my design project.
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) 
    * This was the source of all of the images in my project.
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) 
    * I used TinyPNG to compress my image files to try to reduce the loading time for each page. 
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * I used one Google Font to create my logo and two more to style the content of the website.
- [Gauger Fonticon Generator](https://gauger.io/fonticon/) 
    * This free interactive Fonticon Generator allowed me to create a fonticon with a Font Awesome icon and style it with the colours from my colour scheme.
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
    * This was a great tool throughout the project to test my HTML and CSS code.
- [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    * I've refered to WSC Schools several times whilst building my project, especially when designing the modal for my contact form, as described [here.](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    * Although it isn't a technology, I found a lot of guidance on Stack Overflow and used [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/609273/convert-an-image-to-grayscale-in-html-css*/) to help me make images interactive on hover.

## Testing
    The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)

### Testing User Stories

1. As a potential customer, I want to see services on offer and get a feel for the company.
- The user is presented with a high-contrast, easily readable navigation bar with links to other pages on the site. 
- The eye is also drawn down to the hero image, with contrasting text clarifying what the company provides in just a few words.
- The user can then scroll down to read more about the company, with “What we do” visible in tablet and mobile to invite scrolling. 
- A ‘Back to top’ button is provided on all pages once the user scrolls a certain amount, and the nav bar is stuck to the top of the screen as you scroll, so the user never gets stuck at the bottom of a page with nowhere to go.
2. As a potential customer who has had a bad experience at a competitor, I want to know who the groomers are and if they are reliable.
- A description of the team and their qualifications is provided on the home page, immediately followed by testimonials and links to social media for further investigation of the company’s reputation.
3. As a potential user, I browse websites on my mobile phone and want to have a good experience and be able to find and view the information I want.
- The website is responsive on smaller screens with the result being an aesthetically pleasing as well as functional site on all screens.
4. As a potential customer I want to know if this place is easy to get to.
- In addition to the address and contact information in the footer, there is also a page with an embedded google map, and parking/public transport information.
5. As a potential customer I want to know what other people say about this business.
Testimonials are found on the home page, and the links to social media are visible on the high-contrast footer on every page.
6. As a returning or potential customer I want to be reminded of the services available and be able to make a booking easily.
- The services are laid out in a clear and clean manner, with a text description, as well as pictograms to provide information at a glance. A ‘Book Now’ button under every different service links to the Bookings page.
- The Bookings page has a short form with required fields, as well as the phone number at the top of the page for those who prefer to call.
- The contact information for phone and email are also provided in the footer on every page.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
    -   A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
-   On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.

## Credits

### Code

- The Bootstrap Library and documentation version 4.5.2 was used extensively throughout the project in order to ensure responsiveness across the site, and also to implement certain elements like the card and carousel features.

- Stack Overflow was invaluable, in particular for fixing certain Bootstrap issues.

- Google Maps was used to choose a fictional location and their iframe code was copied to the website in order to embed the map.

- The 'Back to Top' button was based on the code at [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/matthewcain/pen/ZepbeR)
