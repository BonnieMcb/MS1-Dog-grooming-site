Happy Dogs is a website for a fictional dog grooming business that offers various salon services for dogs. Inspiration for the idea came from a family member who is working on creating such a business for themselves. 
The brief for this first Milestone project was to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using HTML5 and CSS3. It is the first of four projects as part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

In terms of my fictional business, the goal was to make a user-friendly website to attract new customers and to facilitate the booking process. 


I wanted the style of the website to feel professional without being too fancy... approachable without being too cutesey. I believe 'modern' would describe the style. I used this to inform my choices on colours, images and fonts.
